It's been about a week and half into 2015.  

Let's talk about New Year's resolutions.

One of the reasons why people don't succeed with their new year's resolutions is that their plan is too ambitious or too complex. They feel overwhelmed and already at a negative mindset in the beginning. With all things considered, another year goes by with a failed new years resolution and no change in results or habits.  

A way to solve this issue is by setting smaller, but frequent goals. Break down your resolution into smaller goals that you can accomplish each week. Break those goals down into things you can do each day. And finally(the most important thing), do the task with one of your daily habits. For example, if your resolution is to read each day, do your reading right before dinner. You must finish your 10-20 pages before you eat your meal. This forces you to do reading with something you do everyday, which is very effective. 

If you manage to break down your big goals into smaller goals and plan it out correctly, things work out much better. There's no reason to give up on your new year's resolution.
