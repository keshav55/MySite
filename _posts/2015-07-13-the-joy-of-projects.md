I love projects, especially coding projects. 

I just completed a milestone in my summer project here at UCSD. For a while, I've been trying to find out a database for client side javascript that can handle large amounts of information and allow for fast queries of data. Finally, I found the perfect database system(PouchDB) that could handle a large csv file I was processing effectively.

While I enjoyed completing the small task, the best moments I had, even if it's hard to realize, were the tough ones. The ones where I had to learn something completely new, test my skills, and build confidence in code. 

I had doubts about the way I was building the project. I kept it all client-side, meaning no backend/server-side code. Since I had doubts that this was an efficient way to go, I tested out different web frameworks and languages that could make my life easier.

Python, Meteor.js, Various Javascript libraries, etc..

While I may have not used any of these frameworks and libraries, I learned a whole lot. It's easy to think that this time was lost because it had not direct contribution to the project, but in reality it wasn't. That "wasted" time led me to an invaluable learning experience that may help with future projects.

And that's an experience you'll get by doing programming projects.
