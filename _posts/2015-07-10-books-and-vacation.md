Read a book next time you go on vacation.

When I went to Hawaii a couple weeks back, I brought a book(Mastery by Robert Greene) and read it during the night or long car drives.

The process of reading the book coupled with a unique vacation location made it an amazing reading experience - one that will be memorable for a long time.

When I recall certain places that I went to during the trip, a certain concept or event from the book pops up in my mind. Yesterday, I was browsing through the best beaches in the United States when suddenly I remembered a topic in the book that I read about while going to the beach. When I look back to the book, I recall things like the places I saw, the food I ate, and the activies I participated in. When I remember moments I had during the vacation, I recall interesting facts I never knew about, concepts important to my life, and quotes that changed my perception of the world.

Taking a book on a trip to paradise is one of the best things you can do.
