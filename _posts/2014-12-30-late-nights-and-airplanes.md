I really appreciate late nights and airplane trips. Honestly, these are the best times to get work done.  

During an airplane trip, you are forced to disconnect with the internet. People around you are silent and most of the time not distracting. With the ambient sounds inside the airplane, you have an environment where your productivity can simply increase. 

It's a similar situation for late night work. Most of your friends are not online on Facebook, so there's no one distracting you. There's no TV or loud noises since everyone else is sleeping. Best of all, you're in an alpha state of mind, ready to read, write, or push code. 

Your environment plays a serious role in your productivity. With less distractions, you are capable of finishing even more work than you expected.
