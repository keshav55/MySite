Hello World!

I decided to create a blog for a couple of reasons.  

1. To improve my writing  
2. To explore new thoughts and insights  
3. To remember my experiences  

Blogging is a great activity. My goal is to stay committed at least for 1 year, writing 2 times per week at least. Let's see how it goes!
